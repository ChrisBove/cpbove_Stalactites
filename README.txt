This Stalactites implementation follows the definition provided by this Wikipedia page:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalactites_(solitaire)

A cell to cell move is not considered, as it cannot alter gameplay outcome, and the article states that 
"...once a card is placed on the reserve, it must be built on a foundation." Having this move would contradict
the idea that a card is locked in the cell unless it can be freed by being placed directly on the foundation.

According to Professor Heineman's suggestion, the ones vs twos playstyle is determined by the first valid move the player makes.

I believe I've linked the package to work under the "git" directory which contains "cs3733b16", but please let me know if you have trouble.

Thank you - Christopher Bove
